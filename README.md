🥛 Milking Website
🌱 About the Project

Milking Website is a React + Tailwind CSS-based web application that showcases:

🐄 Our farm practices – humane, organic, and farmer-led dairy.
🥛 Our dairy products – milk, curd, ghee, butter, and paneer.
🚜 Our journey – highlighting the story, vision, and achievements of the farm.
🌿 A look at Maggemane farm life through gallery, farm visits, and videos.

The main purpose of the website is to inform and build trust with customers by showing the transparency of our work, from farm to table.
